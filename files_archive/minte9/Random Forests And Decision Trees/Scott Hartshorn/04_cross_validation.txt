<i>This is a technique known as Cross Validation and it is extremely useful.
Once you make a machine learning model, you set aside a
portion, say 10%, of your training data before you train on it.</i> 
After fitting your machine learning algorithm to your training data, you
can run the 10% set aside through your classifier and find out if those
predictions match the actual values.
