<i>In many implementations of the Random Forest algorithm, it will
use the square root of the number of features as the maximum
features that it will look on any given branch.</i> Using fewer than all
of the available features is another way to add randomness to the
results (and avoid overfitting) as well as reduce the time required to
create the trees.
