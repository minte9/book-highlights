<i>In scikit-1earn, data is usually denoted with a capital X,
while labels are denoted by a lowercase y. This is inspired by the
standard formulation f(x)=y in mathematics, where x is the input
toa function and y is the output.</i> Following more conventions
from mathematics, we use a capital X because the data is a two-
dimensional array (a matrix) and a lowercase y because the target is
a one-dimensional array (a vector).
