<i>In contrast to NumPy, which requires that all entries in an array 
be of the same type, pandas allows each column to have a separate type 
(for example, integers, dates, floating-point numbers, and strings).</i>  
Another valuable tool provided by pandas is its ability to ingest from 
a great variety of file formats and databases, like SQL, Excel files, CSV files.
