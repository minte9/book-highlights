<i>One of the best ways to inspect data is to visualize it. One way to
do this is by using a scatter plot. A scatter plot of the data puts one
feature along the x-axis and another along the y-axis, and draws
a dot for each data point.</i> Unfortunately, computer screens have
only two dimensions. It is difficult to plot datasets with more
than three features this way. One way around this problem is to do
a pair plot, which looks at all possible pairs of features.
