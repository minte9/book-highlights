<i>Remember that supervised learning is used whenever we want to
predict a certain outcome from a given input, and we have examples
of input/output pairs.</i> We build a machine learning model from
these input/output pairs, which comprise our training set. Our
goal is to make accurate predictions for new, never-before-seen
data. Supervised learning often requires human effort to build.
