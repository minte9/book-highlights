<i>The goal in Machine Learning is to find a generic model 
that optimally balances the overfitting and underfitting
of data</i>. Model complexity is defined with the hyperparameters
of the model itself. Each model has its own set of
hyperparameters. The complexity of a KNN classifier is defined
by the hyper-parameter k.
