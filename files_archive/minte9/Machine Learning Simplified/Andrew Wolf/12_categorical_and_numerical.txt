Many real-world problems have the following structure:
given an object with a set of known, or observed,
measurements, predict the value of an unknown, or target
variable. <i>Simply put, supervised machine learning
models try to predict either a categorical target variable
(predicting a fruit category based on its weight and height), 
or a numerical target variable (predicting the price of an apartment, 
based on its area and location).</i>
