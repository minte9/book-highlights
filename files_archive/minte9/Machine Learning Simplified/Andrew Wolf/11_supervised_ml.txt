Broadly speaking, <i>the goal of supervised ML is to make
predictions about unknown quantities given known
quantities, such as predicting a house's sale price based
on its location and square footage</i>, or predicting a fruit
category given the fruitâ€™s width and height. Supervised
ML does this by learning from, or discovering patterns
in, past data, such as past house sale prices.
