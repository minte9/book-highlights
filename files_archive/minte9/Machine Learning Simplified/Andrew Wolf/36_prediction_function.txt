Formally, supervised ML seeks to learn a prediction function f
that maps each joint setting of the input variables features to
a value of the target variable, X -> y. <i>In our fruit classification
example, we must learn a function that maps any combination
of height and width of a fruit to a (predicted) fruit type</i>.
