<i>Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as
English. Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people, they
evolved naturally.
Formal languages are languages that are designed by people
for specific applications.</i> For example, the notation that
mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly
good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.
