<i>Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so
it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important,
so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right.</i>
Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying
the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details
matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can
get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in
a formal language.
