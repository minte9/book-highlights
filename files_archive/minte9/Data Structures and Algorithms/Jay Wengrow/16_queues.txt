<i>You can think of a queue as a line of people at the movie theater.
The first one in the line is the first one to leave the line and enter
the theater.</i> With queues, the first item added to the queue is the
first item to be removed. That's why computer scientists apply the
acronym FIFO to queues: First In. First Out.
