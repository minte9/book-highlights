<i>When a problem is solved by solving smaller versions of the same
problem, the smaller problem is called a subproblem. 
Dynamic programming is the process of optimizing recursive problems that 
have overlapping subproblems.</i> In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, we
compute each number by first computing the smaller numbers in
the sequence.
