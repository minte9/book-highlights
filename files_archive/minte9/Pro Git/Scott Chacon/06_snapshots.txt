<i>Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature
filesystem. Every time you commit, it basically takes a picture of what all your files
look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</i>
To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the
file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already
stored.
