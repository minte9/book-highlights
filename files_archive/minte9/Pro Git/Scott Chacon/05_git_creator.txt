In 2005, the relationship between the community that
developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that
developed BitKeeper broke down, and the toolâ€™s free-of-charge
status was revoked. <i>This prompted the Linux development
community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of
Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons
they learned while using BitKeeper.</i>
