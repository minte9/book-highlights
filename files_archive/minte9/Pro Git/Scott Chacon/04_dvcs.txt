<i>In a Distributed Version Control Systems (such as Git, Mercurial or Bazaar), 
clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of the files, they fully
mirror the repository.</i> Thus if any server dies, any of the client repositories can be
copied back up to the server to restore it. Every checkout is really
a full backup of all the data.
