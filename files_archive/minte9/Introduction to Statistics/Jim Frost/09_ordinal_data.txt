<i>Ordinal data have at least three categories, and the categories have a natural order. Examples of ordinal
variables include overall status (poor to excellent), agreement (strongly disagree to strongly agree).</i>  
Ordinal variables have a combination of qualitative and quantitative properties. On the one hand,
these variables have a limited number of discrete values like categorical variables.
