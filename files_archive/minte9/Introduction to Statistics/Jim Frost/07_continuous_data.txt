As I mentioned in the section about continuous variables, notice how we learn much less from qualitative
data. I highlight this aspect in a later section about binary variables. <i>In cases where you have a choice
about recording a characteristic as a continuous or qualitative variable, the best practice is to record the
continuous data because you can learn so much more.</i>
