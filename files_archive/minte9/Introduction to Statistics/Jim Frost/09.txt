<i>Ordinal variables have a combination of qualitative and quantitative properties. On the one hand,
these variables have a limited number of discrete values like categorical variables.</i> On the other hand,
the differences between the values provides some information like qualitative variables.</i> However, the
difference between adjacent values might not be consistent. For example, first, second, and third in a race
are ordinal data. The difference in time between first and second place might not be the same as the
difference between second and third place.
